<h1><big>SUMMER<br />
SNOW STORM</big></h1>

<h2>By ADAM CHASE</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><i>Snow in summer is of course impossible. Any weather expert will
tell you so. Weather Bureau Chief Botts was certain no such
absurdity could occur. And he would have been right
except for one thing. It snowed that summer.</i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It was</span>, as the expression
goes, raining cats and
dogs. Since the Weather Bureau
had predicted fair and
warmer, the Weather Bureau
was not particularly happy
about the meteorological state
of affairs. No one, however
was shocked.</p>

<p>Until it started to snow.</p>

<p>This was on the twenty-fifth
of July in the U.S.A....</p>

<p>Half an hour before the
fantastic meteorological turn
of events, Bureau Chief Botts
dangled the forecast sheet before
Johnny Sloman's bloodshot
eyes and barked, "It's all
over the country by now, you
dunderhead!" Then, as an
afterthought: "Did you write
this?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sloman miserably.</p>

<p>Slowly, Botts said, "Temperature,
eighty degrees. Precipitation
expected: snow.
<i>Snow</i>, Sloman. Well, that's
what it says."</p>

<p>"It was a mistake, Chief.
Just&mdash;heh-heh&mdash;a mistake."</p>

<p>"The prediction should
have been for fair and warmer!"
Botts screamed.</p>

<p>"But it's raining," Sloman
pointed out.</p>

<p>"We make mistakes," said
Botts in a suddenly velvety
voice. Then, as if <i>that</i> had
been a mistake, bellowed:
"But not this kind of mistake,
Sloman! Snow in July! We
have a reputation to maintain!
If not for accuracy, at
least for credulity."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Johnny Sloman.
One of the troubles was,
he had a hangover. Although,
actually, that was a consequence
of the real trouble.
The real trouble was his
fiancee. Make that his ex-fiancee.
Because last night Jo-Anne
had left him. "You&mdash;you're
just going no place at
all, Johnny Sloman," she had
said. "You're on a treadmill
and&mdash;not even running very
fast." She had given him back
the quarter-carat ring tearfully,
but Johnny hadn't argued.
Jo-Anne had a stubborn
streak and he knew when Jo-Anne's
mind was made up. So
Johnny had gone and gotten
drunk for the first time since
the night after college graduation,
not too many years ago,
and the result was a nationally-distributed
forecast of
snow.</p>

<p>Chief Botts' first flush of
anger had now been replaced
by self-pity. His red, loose-jowled
face was sagging and
his eyes became watery as he
said, "At least you could have
double-checked it. As a member
of this Bureau you only
have to fill out the forecast
once every ten days. Is that so
hard? Is there any reason
why you should predict snow
for July 25th?" His voice became
silky soft as he added,
"You realize, of course, Sloman,
that if this was anything
but a civil service job
you'd be out on your ear for a
stunt like this! Well, there
are other ways. I can pass
over you for promotion. I <i>intend</i>
to pass over you until
the crack of doom. You'll be a
GS-5 the rest of your working
life. Are you satisfied, Sloman?
Snow in July ..." Chief
Botts' voice trailed off, the
Chief following it.</p>

<p>Johnny sat with his head in
his hands until Harry Bettis,
the GS-5 weatherman who
shared his small office with
him, came in. Naturally,
hangover or no, Johnny had
reported for work first.
Johnny was always first in
the office, but it didn't seem to
do any good. Now, Harry
Bettis could come in an hour
late and read the funnies half
the day and flirt with the secretarial
staff the other half
and still be Chief Botts' odds-on
favorite for the promotion
that was opening next month.
Harry Bettis was like that.</p>

<p>He came in and gave
Johnny the full treatment.
First the slow spreading
smile. Then the chuckle. Then
the loud, roaring belly-laugh.
"Gals outside told me!" he
shouted, loud enough so the
girls outside would know he
knew they had told him.
"Snow! Snow in July! Sloman,
you kill me! You really
do!"</p>

<p>"Do you have to shout?"
Johnny said.</p>

<p>"Do I? We all ought to
shout this. To the rooftops!
Sloman, my foot. You have a
new name, sonny. Snowman!
Johnny Snowman."</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/001.png" width="326" height="500" alt="" title="" />
<small><b>Thick mud held him while terror ravened at his heels.</b></small></div>

<p>Johnny groaned. Instinctively,
he knew the name
would stick.</p>

<p>"Hear you had a little trouble
with the gal-friend this
past p.m.," Harry Bettis
clucked in a voice which managed
to be both derisive and
sympathetic.</p>

<p>"How did you find out?"
Johnny asked, but knew the
answer at once. Jo-Anne was
a roommate of one of the Bureau
Secretaries. It was how
Johnny had met her.</p>

<p>"You know how I found
out, Snowman. Well, that's
tough luck, kiddo. But tell me,
does that mean the field is
wide open? I always thought
your gal-friend&mdash;your <i>ex</i>-gal-friend&mdash;had
the cutest pair
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do with
whether the field is open or
not open, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Well, don't be. Afraid, I
mean," Harry Bettis advised
jovially. "If the gal could
make you pull a boner like
that, you're better off without
her. But I forgot to ask Maxine:
can I have little Jo-Anne's
phone number? Huh,
boy?"</p>

<p>Before Johnny could answer,
the three-girl staff of
secretaries entered the small
office. Entered&mdash;and stared.</p>

<p>"That's all right, girls,"
Harry Bettis said. "You
didn't have to follow me in
here. I'd have been right out."</p>

<p>But they weren't staring at
Harry Bettis. They were staring
at Johnny. Their mouths
had flapped open, their eyes
were big and round. Johnny
didn't, but Harry Bettis knew
that look on a girl's face.
Without any trouble at all,
Johnny could have made any
of those girls, right there,
right then, without even trying.</p>

<p>They gawked and gawked.
One of them pointed at the
window. The others tried to,
but their hands were trembling.</p>

<p>The one who was pointing
squawked: "Look!"</p>

<p>The second one said, "Out
the window!"</p>

<p>The third one said, "Will
you!"</p>

<p>Outside the window on the
twenty-fifth of July it was
snowing.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was an hour later. Telephones
were ringing. Long-distance
calls from all over
the country now that the
ticker had gone out with the
incredible fact that it was
snowing in the Northeast in
July. Most of the calls,
though, were from Washington.
Chief Botts disconnected
the PBX and walked in a
dazed, staggering fashion to
Johnny, smiling weakly and
saying:</p>

<p>"Sloman, I misjudged you.
Genius, right here, right now,
in this office, and we never
knew it. Sloman, I have to admit
I was wrong about you.
But how did you know? How
did you ever know?"</p>

<p>"Hell's bells," Harry Bettis
said before Johnny could say
it was all a mistake. "That's
easy, Chief. Anyone knows
that <i>all</i> rain starts out as
snow. It's got to. You see, the
droplets of moisture in the
cold upper regions of a cloud
condense around dust particles
because the air up there
is too cold to hold them as
vapor. Since it's below freezing,
snow is formed&mdash;snow
which warms up as it passes
through hotter air en route to
the ground, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will be quite enough,
Bettis," Chief Botts said. "I
am a weatherman too, you
know. You don't have to tell
me the most elementary of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In this case, Chief," Bettis
persisted, "the biggest inversion
layer you ever saw kept
the surface air down and
brought the cold upper air
very close to the surface. Result:
the snowflakes didn't
have a chance to melt, not
even to freezing rain. Result:
snow!"</p>

<p>"The chances of that happening,"
said Chief Botts
coldly, "are about one in a
billion. Aren't they, Sloman,
dear fellow?"</p>

<p>"One in two billion,"
Johnny said.</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> modest," Chief Botts
told the staff. "He seems so
unconcerned."</p>

<p>Just then Maxine came into
the little office. The look of
awe on her face had been replaced
by one of sheer amazement.
"Well, I checked it,
Chief," she said. "Wait until
I tell Jo-Anne!"</p>

<p>"Won't you please tell us
first?" Chief Botts asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Maxine,
and read from the memo pad
in her hand. "Since coming to
work for the Bureau, Johnny
Sloman has once every ten
days made our official forecast.
I have checked back on
his forecast, Chief, as you directed.
Johnny has made
fifty-five forecasts. While only
one of them&mdash;startlingly&mdash;has
called for snow in July&mdash;every
single one of them has
been right."</p>

<p>There was a shocked silence.
"But&mdash;but the Weather
Bureau average is only
eighty-eight percent!" Harry
Bettis gasped.</p>

<p>"You mean," Chief Botts
corrected him, "eighty-eight
percent is the figure we try to
foist on the unsuspecting public.
Actually, the Weather Bureau
averages a bare seventy-five
percent, and you know
it."</p>

<p>"But Sloman's got a hundred
percent accuracy&mdash;up to
and including snow in July,"
Harry Bettis said in a shocked
voice.</p>

<p>"It was only an accident,"
Johnny said in a mild voice.
"I didn't mean to write
snow."</p>

<p>"Accident, smaccident,"
said Harry Bettis. "It was no
accident with a record like
that. You have the uncanny
ability to forecast weather
with complete accuracy,
Johnny-boy. You realize what
that means, old pal?"</p>

<p>"I'd better call Washington
and tell them," Chief Botts
said, but Harry Bettis held
his arm while Johnny mused:</p>

<p>"I guess I realize what it
means, Harry. That is, if
you're right. No more getting
wet on picnics. Because I'd
know. I'd know, Harry. No
more going to ball games and
having them rained out on
you. No more being caught
by a thunderstorm at the
beach ..."</p>

<p>"Johnny!" Harry Bettis
said. "Think, pal. Think!"</p>

<p>"I'm calling Washington,"
Chief Botts said. "This is too
much for me."</p>

<p>But Harry Bettis was still
holding his arm. "Now, just a
minute, bucko," he said.
"You're not calling anyone&mdash;not
without his manager's
permission."</p>

<p>"Whose manager's permission?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Sloman's manager's
permission, of course.
In a word, me."</p>

<p>"This is preposterous!"
Chief Botts cried.</p>

<p>"Is it?" Bettis asked. "Listen,
Johnny, don't let anyone
sell you a bill of goods&mdash;like
the Civil Service Commission
giving you a GS-8 rating and
sending you to Washington.
Because stick with me, kid,
and there'll be great things in
store for you, you'll see."</p>

<p>"Such," said Maxine dubiously,
"as what?"</p>

<p>"Are you on our side?"
Harry Bettis asked her suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I'm on Jo-Anne's side. If
old Johnny here has something
she ought to have, I
want to know it."</p>

<hr />

<p>"You mean, if she ought to
change her mind and marry
him? I'll admit it even if I
think Jo-Anne's a real cute
trick: she'd be nuts if she
didn't." Women, Harry Bettis
did not add, never came between
Harry Bettis and ten
percent of a gold mine. But
that's what he was thinking.
He went on: "Just think of it,
Johnny. Drought in the Midwest.
They call Sloman. Sloman
predicts rain. It rains.
Have any idea what they'd
pay for a stunt like that? Or
swollen rivers in New England,
or California. Looks like
another big flood is on the
way, but they call Sloman.
Looks like rain, kiddo? That
don't matter. Predict a dry
spell and it won't rain. Do
you know," Harry Bettis said
in a devout whisper, "what a
stunt like that would be
worth? Millions."</p>

<p>"Yeah, wise guy," said
Maxine. "So what's in it for
you?"</p>

<p>Harry Bettis did not look
at Maxine when he answered.
He looked at Johnny and said,
"I'll be frank, kiddo. You
have the talent, but you don't
have the salesmanship to promote
it. Do you want a mediocre
job while the weather
boys exploit you for the rest
of your life or&mdash;do you want
greatness, riches, and Jo-Anne?"</p>

<p>"Jo-Anne," Johnny said.</p>

<p>Harry Bettis nodded. "My
price is twenty-five percent."</p>

<p>"Of Jo-Anne?" Maxine asked
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Of everything Johnny
makes as the world's first <i>real</i>
Weather Man. Not a forecaster&mdash;a
commander. Because
when my client forecasts the
weather, it happens. Brothers
and sisters, it happens." He
turned abruptly to Johnny,
said, "You have any money
saved up?"</p>

<p>"A few hundred dollars,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An ad in the papers.
Alongside the article telling
how it snowed on July twenty-fifth.
Saying that your services
are for hire. We're a shoo-in,
kid!"</p>

<p>"Well, if you say so,"
Johnny said doubtfully.</p>

<p>"So don't call D.C.," Bettis
told Chief Botts.</p>

<p>"But Sloman's an employee
of this Bureau."</p>

<p>"Was, you mean."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Was an employee. He ain't
an employee now. He's quitting&mdash;with
his manager,"
said Harry Bettis, and walked
out of the office, steering a
dazed Johnny Sloman with
him.</p>

<p>"Wait until I call Jo-Anne,"
Maxine said.</p>

<p>During the next six months,
Johnny Sloman&mdash;known to
the world as The Weather
Man&mdash;made fifty million dollars.
Since it had taken a
whole lifetime for him to develop
his remarkable talent,
his lawyers were trying to
have capital gains declared on
the earnings rather than
straight income tax. The odds
seemed to be in their favor.</p>

<p>How had Johnny made his
fifty million dollars? By predicting
the weather. He predicted:</p>

<p>A flood in the Texas panhandle&mdash;in
time to save the
dry lands from going entirely
arid.</p>

<p>An end of the snowstorms
in northern Canada&mdash;which
had trapped the five hundred
residents of a small uranium-mining
town without food or
adequate drinking water.</p>

<p>The break-up of Hurricane
Anita&mdash;which had threatened
to be the most destructive
ever to strike the Carolina
Coast.</p>

<p>No frost for Florida that
winter&mdash;a prediction still to
be ascertained, but a foregone
conclusion.</p>

<p>Every prediction had come
true. In time, the world began
to realize that his predictions
were not predictions at all:
they were sure things. That
is, they predicted nothing&mdash;they
<i>made</i> things happen.
Johnny was in demand everywhere
and naturally could not
fill all engagements. Harry
Bettis hired a whole squad
of corresponding secretaries,
whose job it was to turn
down, with regret, some ninety
percent of the jobs requested.
Johnny, in fact, was
in such demand, that his engagement
to Jo-Anne&mdash;which,
of course, had been reinstated
at her insistence&mdash;remained
only an engagement. The nuptials
were put off, and put off
again.</p>

<p>This suited Harry Bettis,
who saw to it that Johnny
kept putting off the marriage.
Because, ultimately, Jo-Anne
would reach the end of her
proverbial tether and decide
that Harry's twenty-five percent,
if it could be shared
as a wife, was better than
Johnny's seventy-five percent,
if it could not.</p>

<p>Jo-Anne, though, was not
that kind of girl. Harry Bettis,
knowing no other kind of
girl, never understood that.</p>

<p>The scientists, meanwhile,
had a field day with Johnny.
His strange talent obeyed no
natural law, they said, and at
first attributed it to random
chance. Soon, though, this became
patently impossible.
And so a new natural law was
sought. All types of hair-brained
theories were proposed,
none of them accepted,
until an osteopathic physician
in Duluth, Minn., hit upon the
theory that staggered the
world with its simplicity and,
eventually, was accepted as
that which explained the
strange phenomenon of
Johnny Sloman.</p>

<p>The osteopath, many of
whose patients suffered from
rheumatism which was aggravated
by the bitter Minnesota
winters, suggested that
Johnny Sloman was a case of
rheumatism in reverse. The
weather, he pointed out, had
an adverse effect upon the
symptoms of his patients.
Conversely, why couldn't some
human being&mdash;a Johnny Sloman,
for example&mdash;affect the
weather in precisely the same
way that the weather invariably
affected his rheumatic
patients?</p>

<p>It was clear, simple, lucid.
It was the only theory which
could not be disproven by the
weight of scientific knowledge.
It thus became the accepted
theory.</p>

<hr />

<p>"The Under-Secretary of
Defense to see you," Maxine
said one day during the winter
following Johnny's July
snowfall.</p>

<p>"Don't see him," Harry
Bettis said. "You don't want
to see him."</p>

<p>"But why not?" Johnny
asked.</p>

<p>"Because they'll make you
a dollar-a-year man and we're
not in this to make any stinking
dollar a year," Harry Bettis
said.</p>

<p>"Well, I think I ought to
see him, anyway. At least see
him." He turned to Jo-Anne,
who was sitting at the next
desk, writing up some reports.
"What do you think, Jo?"</p>

<p>"If the country needs you,
Johnny," she said, "it's your
duty to help."</p>

<p>Johnny told Maxine, "Show
the Under-Secretary in,
please."</p>

<p>He was a small man with a
big brief case. He spoke slowly,
earnestly, backing up his
statements with reams of
paper from the brief case. The
Defense Department had not
contacted Johnny right away,
he said, because they wanted
to compile all the facts. They
had all the facts now.</p>

<p>Johnny Sloman could be the
biggest single factor for peace
the world had ever known.</p>

<p>Item. In the event of aggression,
he could so bog
down the aggressor's supply
lines and troop movements
with continuous rains and
snowstorms that it would be
all but impossible for the aggressor
to maintain hostilities.</p>

<p>Item. In the event that such
tactical weather-war failed,
he could cause a drought in
the aggressor's food-producing
regions, forcing the aggressor
to surrender or face
starvation.</p>

<p>Item. He could always, conversely,
see to it that the defensive
force's supply lines
were never hampered by the
weather and that the precipitation
over the defensive country's
breadbasket was ideal.</p>

<p>Item. He could render aggressor
communication difficult
with heavy fog and/or
icy roads.</p>

<p>Item. He could cover defensive
troop movements with
low, dense clouds.</p>

<p>In short, concluded the
Under-Secretary, Johnny Sloman
could be a one-man world
police-force practically guaranteeing
peace. He stopped
talking. He looked at Johnny.
His eyes said, the call of duty
is clear.</p>

<p>Harry Bettis said, "Well,
thank you for your time, Mr.
Secretary. Naturally, we'll
think about what you said."</p>

<p>"Think about it!" gasped
the Under-Secretary. "Think
about it!"</p>

<p>"My client is a busy man&mdash;the
busiest man in his field,"
Harry Bettis said.</p>

<p>The Under-Secretary smiled
bleakly. "The only man in
his field, you mean. That's
why we need him."</p>

<p>"We'll send you a report in
a few weeks," Harry said indifferently,
"after we've had
an opportunity to study the
situation."</p>

<p>"But, Harry&mdash;" Johnny began.</p>

<p>"Johnny," Harry said. He
did not have to finish the
statement. It had happened
before&mdash;"Johnny, I've made
you a tremendous success. I'm
your manager, aren't I? Let's
leave it that way."</p>

<p>"If Johnny thinks he ought
to help&mdash;" Jo-Anne said.</p>

<p>"Now, Jo-Anne," Harry
Bettis scolded, and led the
Under-Secretary to the door.</p>

<hr />

<p>Three days later, the assistant
chief of the F.B.I. came
to see them. "We regret this,
Sloman," he said.</p>

<p>"You regret what?" Harry
Bettis asked.</p>

<p>"Defense allowed a report
on its findings out. That was
unwise. We'll have to give
you around-the-clock protection,
Sloman."</p>

<p>"Protection from what?"
Johnny wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Enemy agents. The enemy
is desperate. At all costs, according
to their intelligence
reports, they're out to get
you."</p>

<p>"Get him?" said Harry Bettis.
"You mean, kill him?"</p>

<p>"I mean, get him. Get him
on their side. Because everything
Johnny could do for the
forces of peace and democracy,
he could be made to do
for the forces of aggression.
You see?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Johnny.</p>

<p>"No," said Harry Bettis.
"This sounds like a government
trick&mdash;to make Johnny
go to work. To make him
think it's his patriotic
duty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jo-Anne sharply,
"isn't it?"</p>

<p>Harry Bettis smiled. "When
he gets as big as Universal
Motors, he can become patriotic."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sloman," the assistant
F.B.I. chief said, "they
will either try to kidnap you
outright, or work on you
through someone you love.
Therefore, our bodyguards&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, let them keep their
distance, that's all," Bettis
said. "Bad for business. Nobody
wants enemy agents
hanging around."</p>

<p>"That's your final decision?"
the F.B.I. man asked.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" began Johnny.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's our final decision,"
said Harry Bettis,
showing the F.B.I. man to the
door.</p>

<p>"I don't think you should
have done that," Johnny said
after he had gone.</p>

<p>"You just make the weather,
Johnny-boy. I'll take care
of business."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" said Johnny.</p>

<p>"Johnny!" cried Jo-Anne.
"Oh, Johnny! Why don't you
act like a man?" And she ran
from the room, slamming the
door.</p>

<p>After that, Johnny didn't
see her again.</p>

<p>She was gone.</p>

<p>Really gone, for certain,
not simply walking off in a
huff.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, Johnny
got the letter&mdash;unofficial&mdash;from
the Enemy.</p>

<hr />

<p>The F.B.I. was sympathetic,
but the Chief said, "You
can understand, Mr. Sloman,
how our hands are tied. It is
not an official letter. We can't
prove anything. We don't
doubt it for a minute, of
course. The cold war enemy
has kidnapped your fiancee
and taken her to their motherland.
But&mdash;we can't prove it.
Not being able to prove it, we
can't do a thing about it.
You're aware, of course, of
how readily the rest of the
world condemns our actions.
Not that they wouldn't be on
our side if we could prove
that this kidnap letter was
the real thing, but you realize
we won't be able to prove it at
all."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Johnny. He went
home. He saw Harry Bettis,
who said he was shocked. The
note read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Johnny Sloman:</p>

<p>We have Miss Jo-Anne
Davis here in the motherland.
The only way she can
live a normal life here is if
you join her and work for
us. We believe you know
what the other kind of life
is like here.</p></div>

<p>Bettis said, "It stumps the
hell out of me, Johnny."</p>

<p>"I'm just waking up," said
Johnny slowly. "In a way, it's
your fault."</p>

<p>"Now, don't be a jackass,
Johnny."</p>

<p>Jackass or no, Johnny hit
him. His knuckles went
crunch and Harry Bettis' nose
went crunch and Bettis fell
down. He lay there, his nose
not looking so good.</p>

<p>Now, when it was apparently
too late, Johnny knew
what his course of action
should have been. Get rid of
the money-grubbing Bettis.
Go to work for the government
unselfishly. Insure
world peace.</p>

<p>Too late ... too late ...</p>

<p>Because unless he could
somehow save Jo-Anne, he
would never predict the
weather again&mdash;for anyone.</p>

<hr />

<p>"But what you ask is impossible!"
the Secretary of
Defense said a few days later.</p>

<p>"If I come back, if I'm successful,"
Johnny said quietly,
"I'm your man, for as long as
you want me, without pay."</p>

<p>"You mean that?" the Secretary
asked slowly.</p>

<p>"I mean it."</p>

<p>The Secretary nodded grimly,
touched a button on his
desk. "Get me Air Force
Chief of Staff Burns," he said,
and, a moment later: "Bernie?
Chuck here. We need a
plane. A jet-transport to go
you-know-where. Cargo? One
man, in a parachute. Can you
manage it? Immediately, if
not sooner. Good boy, Bernie.
No ... no, I'm sorry, I can't
tell you a thing about it." The
Secretary cut the connection,
turned to Johnny:</p>

<p>"You leave this afternoon,
Sloman. You realize, of
course, there isn't a thing we
can do to get you out. Not a
thing."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Johnny.</p>

<p>"You're a very brave man,
or very much in love."</p>

<p>Hours later, the jet transport
took off with Johnny in
it.</p>

<p>He came down near what
had been the border of the
motherland and Poland. He
began to walk. A farmer and
his son spotted the parachute,
came after him. The son was
a Red Army man on leave.
The son had a gun. He fired
prematurely, and Johnny ran.
It was hopeless, he decided.
He would never make it. He
would never even reach the
capital alive, where they were
holding Jo-Anne.</p>

<p>He ran.</p>

<p>He wished for rain. A
blinding rainstorm. The
clouds scudded in. The rain
fell in buckets. The farmer
and his son soon lost sight of
Johnny.</p>

<p>Just to make sure, Johnny
ran and let it go on raining.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Floods in their motherland,"
the Secretary of Defense
told the President.
"Naturally, their news broadcasts
are trying to keep the
reports to a minimum, but
these are the biggest floods
we've ever heard of over
there."</p>

<p>"Our man is there?" the
President asked.</p>

<p>"He was dropped by parachute,
sir!"</p>

<hr />

<p>It was snowing when
Johnny reached the capital.
He had been parachuted into
the enemy's motherland, naturally,
because propinquity
alone assured the success of
his strange talent.</p>

<p>He was tired. His feet
ached. He'd been the only one
heading for the capital. Hundreds
of thousands had been
fleeing from the floods ...</p>

<p>"There he is!" a voice cried
in the enemy language. He
didn't understand the language,
but he understood
the tone. His picture had been
flashed across the length and
breadth of the motherland.
He had been spotted.</p>

<p>He ran. Down an alley,
across a muddy yard, floundering
to his knees, then his
thighs, in thick mud. They
came floundering in pursuit.
They fired a warning volley
of shots. He stumbled and fell
face down in the black, stinking mud.</p>

<p>They took him ...</p>

<hr />

<p>Dark room. One light, on
his face. A voice: "We can
kill you."</p>

<p>"Kill me," he said. "My last
wish will be for rain. Rain,
forever."</p>

<p>"We can torture you."</p>

<p>"And I will say, before you
start, let it rain and go on
raining. Let me be powerless
to prevent it. Rain!"</p>

<p>"We can kill the girl."</p>

<p>"Your country will float
away."</p>

<p>A fist came at him out of
the darkness. Hit him. It was
tentative torture. He sobbed
and thought: rain, harder.
Rain, rain, rain ...</p>

<p>Water seeped into the dungeon.
This had never happened
before. The fist went away.</p>

<p>Outside it rained and
rained.</p>

<hr />

<p>"What does he want, comrade?"</p>

<p>"We don't know, comrade."</p>

<p>"Give it to him&mdash;whatever
it is. He has disrupted our
entire economy. We face economic
disaster unless he&mdash;and
his rain&mdash;leave us in peace."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is what he
wants. Peace."</p>

<p>"You fool! We are supposed
to want peace. Shut up!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Comrade."</p>

<p>"Better ask the party secretary."</p>

<p>"Yes, comrade."</p>

<p>The party secretary was
asked. The party secretary
sighed and nodded.</p>

<p>Johnny saw the light of
day. And Jo-Anne.</p>

<hr />

<p>A month later, the Secretary
of Defense told him.
"Thanks to you, they agreed
to a German settlement, stopped
sending arms to their
Red ally in Asia, withdrew
their promise of aid to the
Arab fanatics, and have freed
all foreigners held in their
motherland illegally."</p>

<p>Johnny listened, smiling at
Jo-Anne. They had been married
two weeks. Naturally,
the enemy had been only too
glad to see them leave.</p>

<p>"Just stay available, Sloman,"
the President beamed
from alongside the Secretary
of Defense. "As long as they
know we can always send you
over there again, they'll never
try anything. Right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Johnny.</p>

<p>They called him the Weather
Man. They went on calling
him the Weather Man, although
he retired more or less&mdash;except
during cases of dire
emergency.</p>

<p>The world called him that,
the Weather Man. And, because
he had retired to enjoy
life with his new wife, they
began to suspect, as could be
expected, that he had been a
fraud.</p>

<p>But the enemy did not
think so. Ever again.</p>

<p>And that was enough for
Johnny.</p>
